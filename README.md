## What works today

DeckCraft is in alpha, heading for beta (see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).
Today it can:

- **Make decks**: slide masters and eleven layouts with placeholders that inherit position and
  formatting, eight original themes with colour and font schemes, sections, notes, comments,
  headers and footers, custom slide sizes.
- **Draw**: 150+ preset shapes with adjust handles, connectors that stay glued to shapes, freeform,
  curve and scribble tools, merge shapes (union, combine, fragment, intersect, subtract), gradient,
  picture and pattern fills, outlines with dashes and arrowheads, shadows, glow, soft edges and
  reflections.
- **Write**: in-place text editing with full font and paragraph formatting, bullets and numbering,
  columns, autofit, vertical text, fields and hyperlinks.
- **Add content**: pictures with crop and corrections, tables with styles, charts, SmartArt basics,
  audio and video (MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC, Ogg, Opus, WAV, AIFF; H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1).
- **Present**: transitions (including Morph), entrance/emphasis/exit and motion-path animations,
  by-paragraph builds, full-screen slide show, presenter view, pen, rehearse timings, media playback.
- **Exchange files**: open and save .pptx presentations, export PDF (slides, notes pages, handouts
  with selectable text), PNG/JPEG, an animated GIF of the deck and outlines. Unsaved work is kept by AutoRecover.
- **Japanese and equations (DeckCraft-ja)**: a Japanese interface; Japanese line layout, kinsoku,
  hanging punctuation, vertical text and East Asian fonts as PowerPoint for Mac lays them out; the
  macOS input method's conversion and reconversion; Japanese dates and eras; equations typed in TeX
  with a live preview and a history, drawn in Computer Modern and saved as OMML in .pptx; a window
  per presentation and the native macOS menu bar.
- **Automate**: 200+ commands with undo, all scriptable from the CLI, a JSON control channel and an
  MCP server for AI agents.

## Getting started

PDF export uses the shared `craft-pdf` writer with import features disabled. See
[`crates/pdf/README.md`](crates/pdf/README.md) for the dependency and validation requirements.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/goyamamoto/deckcraft
cd deckcraft
cargo run --release -p deckcraft-cli -- render --sample --all --scale 1 out/
```

The Japanese interface and the equation fonts come from two branches beside this repo:
[goyamamoto/craft-i18n](https://github.com/goyamamoto/craft-i18n) `deckcraft-ja-fork` (the Japanese
catalog) and [goyamamoto/craft-fonts](https://github.com/goyamamoto/craft-fonts)
`deckcraft-math-fonts` (craft-fonts plus CMU Serif and STIX Two Math):

```sh
git clone -b deckcraft-math-fonts https://github.com/goyamamoto/craft-fonts ../craft-fonts
git clone -b deckcraft-ja-fork https://github.com/goyamamoto/craft-i18n ../craft-i18n
CRAFT_I18N_DIR="$PWD/../craft-i18n" cargo run --release -p deckcraft
```

Without them DeckCraft-ja builds with an English interface and draws equations in a fallback font.

On Linux, the build also needs the ALSA headers for slide-show sound: `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora,
`libasound2-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu, `alsa-lib` on Arch. Without them it stops at `alsa-sys`.

Fonts come from craft-fonts: a checkout next to this repo (`../craft-fonts`) is picked up
automatically; without it DeckCraft uses your system fonts.

DeckCraft-ja has no ready-made builds yet; build it from source as above. Each upstream
[DeckCraft release](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases) (without the Japanese work) has ready-made builds, on Linux as
an AppImage, a `.deb`, an `.rpm` and a tarball. On Gentoo, the community [::snakebyte
overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the Linux release as
`app-office/deckcraft-bin` (not maintained by the DeckCraft team):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-office/deckcraft-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/deckcraft
emerge --ask app-office/deckcraft-bin
```

### Logs

The desktop app writes its `log` records to standard error and to `logs/deckcraft.log` in the
settings directory, beside `ui.json` and `prefs.json` (Linux `~/.config/deckcraft/logs/`, or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/deckcraft/logs/`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/DeckCraft/logs/`; Windows
`%APPDATA%\DeckCraft\logs\`). A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file
is what to attach to a bug report: the crash guard's panic report, a failed crash-recovery save,
Parts skipped on import and audio output problems land there. Each launch moves the
previous log to `deckcraft.1.log` (and that one to `deckcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that
crashed survives the next start. The file stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log levels for standard error and the log file. Default: `info` for DeckCraft's own crates, `warn` for everything else. env_logger-style directives replace that, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`, `RUST_LOG=warn,deckcraft_pptx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*` covers every target starting with it (`deckcraft*=debug`). |

The logger is `apps/deckcraft/src/logging.rs`; the realtime audio callback does not log. The web
app logs to the browser console instead.

## Agents, CLI and MCP

Every action in DeckCraft is a command with a stable id, so people, scripts and AI agents use the
same verbs:

```sh
deckcraft-cli commands format.          # list commands
deckcraft-cli run --sample --cmd 'slide.new={"layout":"titleOnly","title":"Hello"}' --save hello.deckcraft
deckcraft-cli mcp                       # MCP server over stdio (headless)
deckcraft-cli mcp --connect 7990        # drive the running app (deckcraft --control 7990)
deckcraft-cli mcp --automation-read-root DIR --automation-write-root DIR   # confine the headless agent to folders
```

## Roadmap

DeckCraft is in **alpha**. It covers **84% of the features tracked in [`docs/target-app-parity.md`](docs/target-app-parity.md) by breadth** (92% of the core
ones, measured) and is about **55% ready for real work across all tracked capabilities** (estimated).
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the stage, numbers by dimension and what's next,
[docs/target-app-parity.md](docs/target-app-parity.md) for the full assessment,
[docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md) for every known shortfall and
[docs/parity-checklist.md](docs/parity-checklist.md) for the feature-by-feature checklist.

## Downloads

DeckCraft-ja has no releases of its own yet. These are upstream DeckCraft's builds, without the
Japanese work.

**Download DeckCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\deckcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

DirectX 12 shaders are compiled with FXC, which is part of Windows, so no `dxcompiler.dll` or
`dxil.dll` is needed ("Parent device is lost" at start, #153). `$env:WGPU_DX12_COMPILER = "dxc"`
(or `"auto"`) selects wgpu's DXC handling again for troubleshooting.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `deckcraft-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `deckcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.AppImage` | Runs anywhere; updates itself with [AppImageUpdate](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate) (`.zsync` files) |
| Flatpak | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |

RISC-V 64 (riscv64): `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-riscv64.tar.gz`, a tarball only (cross-compiled; needs glibc 2.39+, e.g. Ubuntu 24.04+).

**Runtime libraries.** The window-system, GPU and file-dialog libraries DeckCraft needs are opened
when the app starts (`dlopen` through `x11-dl`, `xkbcommon-dl`, `ash`, `glutin` and `rfd`) instead
of being linked in, so `ldd` shows none of them: an install that satisfies the linked dependencies
can still fail at start-up with a loader error and no hint of what to install. Only
`libasound.so.2` (slide-show sound) is a hard link-time dependency, and only of the `deckcraft`
GUI — `deckcraft-cli` uses neither sound nor a display. The `.deb` and `.rpm` declare the set in
`packaging/linux/nfpm.yaml`; a tarball install or a musl system has to provide it itself:

```sh
apk add libx11 libxcursor libxrandr libxi libxkbcommon xkeyboard-config \
        wayland-libs-client alsa-lib \
        vulkan-loader mesa-vulkan-swrast \
        mesa-gl mesa-egl mesa-dri-gallium \
        xdg-desktop-portal
```

Alpine Linux `v3.22` names above; Void's musl variant uses the same `/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`
loader and the same libraries as `libX11 libXcursor libXrandr libXi libxkbcommon xkeyboard-config
wayland alsa-lib vulkan-loader mesa xdg-desktop-portal`. There is no musl build among the release
artifacts yet — this is what a build from source on musl needs at run time, and what a future musl
artifact will need (#954).

- `mesa-vulkan-swrast` is the software Vulkan driver: it runs anywhere, VMs and containers
  included. On a real GPU install your vendor's driver instead (`mesa-vulkan-intel`,
  `mesa-vulkan-ati`, `mesa-vulkan-nouveau`, …).
- Without Vulkan the app falls back to CPU rendering through Mesa's GL drivers. It works, but
  slowly — a driver limit, not a DeckCraft bug.
- `xdg-desktop-portal` (with `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` or `-kde`; `-wlr` has no file chooser, so
  on wlroots compositors install `zenity`) is what the Open and Save dialogs talk to; `xkeyboard-config` holds the XKB keyboard data `libxkbcommon` reads.
- fontconfig and freetype are not needed: DeckCraft reads `/usr/share/fonts` itself and embeds its
  presentation fonts.

Building from source on musl also needs `build-base pkgconf alsa-lib-dev` (`alsa-lib-dev` is the
ALSA headers).

### FreeBSD

| Build | File |
|---|---|
| x86_64 | `deckcraft-<ver>-freebsd-x86_64.tar.gz` |

### Web (WebAssembly)

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static site | `deckcraft-web-<ver>.zip` | Runs in a modern browser; host it on any static server |

## Upstream

DeckCraft-ja follows [storytold/deckcraft](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft) and adds the
Japanese work measured against PowerPoint for Mac with Japanese as its editing language (the
interface, line layout, fonts, input method, dates and units), equations from TeX, and a window per
presentation with the native macOS menu bar. Changes are sent upstream as pull requests; the
branch `goyamamoto/ja-language-support-gaps` holds them without this fork's naming.
